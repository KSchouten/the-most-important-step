It records some of the next steps in my journey through life. Every person has their own journey and their own steps to take. Maybe some of what I write seems obvious to you because you are further down the road for that theme or topic, while other things may be helpful to you. There is a good chance that you disagree with me, which is totally fine. Variety in opinions, personal preferences, and taste is what makes humanity such a curious and endlessly fascinating bunch."
